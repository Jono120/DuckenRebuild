# DuckenRebuild
This website started as a side project for while I have been completing my degree. This has helped me learn new skills that I have been able to use with my classes. This website started off as a basic HTML5/CSS3 website with some basic JavaScript, which has been hosted within GitHub pages.
The new website which is now hosted within the Azure Web Services. This has allowed me to use the .NET Core framework and build new functions for the website using more advanced HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding as well as C# coding tools.
The website was developed as a practical industry experience for using as an example of work and showcasing my skills as a developer.
This has allowed me to continue challenging my skills, and adapting the ones I have.

This is the repository for the new Ducken Website using the .NET Core framework, the new website is hosted within the Microsoft Azure services.

The privacy policy is very basic that has very basic informtion about what the site, and it's connections.
