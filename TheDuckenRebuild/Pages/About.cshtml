            <h2>The Ducken Wellington</h2>
            We are a comfortable, family/farm homestay. Our central heating will keep you cosy during Wellington’s colder and gustier days and nights.
            <br />
            <em>Quality cooked breakfast is included.</em>
            <br />
            There is a comfortable lounge/dining area, including a TV, for your own use. Netflix and Wi-Fi are also available.
            As mentioned, we are only a few minutes walk from the local bus and railway stations.
            We look forward to meeting you on your next visit to Wellington, and making it as comfortable as possible.<br />
            <br />
            <h3>The living space</h3>

            We have two available rooms, sharing one bathroom. The first is a queen size room.
            The second is a king single room, with a roll-away bed for a child.<br />
            <br />
            There is a cosy covered outside area to relax and read in, a large deck with garden furniture, and a BBQ available for your use. The main lounge/dining area is fully furnished.<br />
            You will be welcomed as one of the family during your stay with us.<br />
            <h4>Access</h4>
            As well as the bedrooms, you will have access to the open plan kitchen/dining and family area, as well as a private lounge/dining area to relax, read, play games, or watch TV in.<br />
            <br />
            <h3>Interaction with guests</h3>
            I will be mostly onsite and accessible, with plenty of holiday inspiration and advice on the local area. I am also available to transport guests from the ferry terminal or airport if necessary, for a fee of $25-40 depending.<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Other information about the venue</h4>
        I make my own bread most days, and cook with the fresh free range eggs from the chickens we keep.
        When staying with us, you have the options of:
        <ul style="list-style:square">
            <li>A full cooked breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast</li>
            <li>A continental breakfast</li>
            <li>Cereal with homemade preserves and yoghurt</li>
        </ul>
        Tawa is centrally located with 3 different beaches only a few minute’s drive away, along with surrounding inland walks, both with spectacular views.<br />
        We are located in a quiet area with shops and cafés within close walking distance, and plenty of free parking.<br />
