        <h2>About Us!</h2>
        <p>
            <h2>The Ducken Wellington</h2>
            Is a comfortable family/farm style homestay.
            Our house is centrally heated, which will keep you cozy on colder days and nights.
            <em>Quality cooked breakfast included.</em>
            <br />
            There is a comfortable lounge/dining area for your own use with TV.
            Netflix and Wi-fi is available.
            We are only a few mins walk from the bus/railway station
            We look forward to meeting you on your next visit to Wellington.

            <h3>The space</h3>

            I have two available bedrooms which share one bathroom.
            One room is a queen size room, the other is a king single room with a roll-away for children.<br />
            <br />
            There is a cosy covered sit-out and large deck with garden furniture and BBQ you can use.
            The main lounge/dining area is fully furnished.
            You will be part of our family when you come and stay.
            <br />
            <h3>Guest access</h3>
            As well as the bedrooms, you will have access to open plan kitchen/dining and family room area, as well as a private loung/dining to relax, read, play games, or watch TV.<br />
            <br />
            <h3>Interaction with guests</h3>
            I would be mostly onsite and can help with holiday ideas. I can also pickup from Ferry or Airport if needed, for a minimum fee of $25 - $40<br />
            <br />
            <h4>Other things to note</h4>
            I make my own bread most days and with fresh free range eggs (chickens in the backyard).<br />
            You can have either, a full cooked breakfast of bacon & eggs with toast or continental breakfast, of cereal with homemade preserves and yoghurt.<br />
            Tawa is centrally located to 3 different beaches, only a few minutes drive away with spectacular views and walks.<br />
            We are in a quiet area close to shops and cafés within walking distance and plenty of free parking.<br />
